"Some more stupid fucking feedback about the Walmart SWE job. Did a live coding interview and absolutely bombed it. Just because I didn\u2019t know how to print the cardinality of binary numbers . \n\nIm so upset that I couldn\u2019t just get another fucking question. Studied so fucking hard for this . Days and nights of no sleep. Even had finals in between this . Just to fucking bomb it. As a man its tough to cry . But i just called my mom to talk about it. And i just started to cry. \n\nNot posting this for pity, but just to let you guys know i tried.\n"
